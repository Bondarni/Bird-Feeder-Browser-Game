## Play the owner of a diner in this browser-based breakfast joint who keeps their feathered clientele satisfied with a variety of seed-based dishes.

### Have you looked out at a bird feeder, and seen all your feathered friends flit away when no feed is found?

Can you blame 'em? Just look at this hungry customer!

Be the change you want to see in the world, and sling those seeds to keep those bird beaks beaming, and in the process, attract the fastidious fowl that know their Grade-A Grub from Garbage Gravel, earning you the admiration and acclaim of avians all around!

### Programs/Technologies Used:

- HTML / CSS / Javascript / Adobe Fresco 

For the start, finish, and gameplay pages, I created easy-to-read html pages styled simply with css and hand drawn assets to evoke a fun, casual vibe.
For the game mechanics, I made liberal use of query selectors, event listeners, and functions.  
The game round as an overall timer.  A similar mechanic is used to act as a patience counter for the birds. 

UPDATE: 1/27/23
Future edits of the game will also involve greater styling, and adding some of the VIP features listed below.
In future edits of the game, the more redundant functions will be pared down to be just as effective with less lines of code.

## The Regulars;

[x] Create Bird Customers, and give them a simple way to express appetizer approval or dish disdain.
[x] Create two timer systems; one for the whole round, and one for each customer, serving as their wait time.
- Create points system that will vary based on order.
- Create Diner Foreground and Background.

## The VIPs;

[x] Party Of Five?; Create a welcome page to greet the guest before the game begins.
- We Value Your Feedback; give the clients different expressions and more dialogue options!
  Everyone's A Critic, but one in particular might make or break your career. Suss out the influencer among your guests and make sure to treat them well. If you don't, you might see a dip in business...
- If Music Be The Food Of Love; Write and integrate theme music for game. Something bouncy and fun, but with just enough drive to keep things lively!
- Tips Are Never Expected, But Always Appreciated; facilitate a way for grateful birds to leave a lil' sumthin'.
- Bonus Worm!
- 24-7; You get all sorts after-hours. Different clients will bring different challenges, and might ask for different menu items.
