Be the change you want to see in the world, and sling those seeds to keep those bird beaks beaming, and in the process, attract the fastidious fowl that know their Grade-A Grub from Garbage Gravel, earning you the admiration and acclaim of avians all around!

### Programs/Technologies Used:
- HTML / CSS / Javascript / Adobe Fresco / GarageBand

## The Regulars;

## The VIPs;

- If Music Be The Food Of Love; Write and integrate theme music for game.  Something bouncy and fun, but with just enough drive to keep things lively!
